- # Project Readme: Voice-Enabled ChatGPT Search

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Voice-Enabled ChatGPT Search project! This project aims to transform user input into text, search for relevant results using ChatGPT, and then render the output as both voice and text. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture to provide natural language understanding and generation. VoiceGpt is a web application that aims to add voice functionality to ChatGPT. This is supposed to simulate having a conversation with the AI.

## Features

1. **Text Input:** Users can input their queries using text.

2. **ChatGPT Search:** The project utilizes ChatGPT to search for information based on user input.

3. **Voice Output:** Results are rendered not only as text but also in voice format, providing a seamless and inclusive user experience.
